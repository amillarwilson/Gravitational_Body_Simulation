  <p align="center">
    Though Newton first published his laws of gravitation in July 1687, it is still mathematically impossible to predict all future locations of any more than 2 bodies, thus the famous 3 body problem, 
    here expanded to an N body problem. 
    <br />
    This repo contains code which uses Newton's law of Universal gravitation to overcome this mathematical limit, applying the algorithm below to each body sequentially across time, starting from T=0.

    ## Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

    The force of attraction between two point masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) separated by a distance \(r\) is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:
    
    \[ F = \frac{{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}}{{r^2}} \]
    
    Where:
    - \( F \) is the force of attraction,
    - \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
    - \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects, and
    - \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two objects.
